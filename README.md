# Election-web
 
This final year project's aim was to develop a fully functioning election platform that could be used to handle multiple scopes such as business board elections, organizational elections, and presidential and parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka. It is developed for both the user and admin, users are the voters who use the platform to ballot and the administartors are the officials who are at the election centres. Using this system an individual could cast his valuable vote in seconds and the admin can tabulate these votes to view results in real-time. This system comes with significant improvements to the current system that is used in Sri-Lanka.
